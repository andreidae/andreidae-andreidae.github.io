The 16th Danish Marine Mammal Symposium 2020 will take place on the 6th and 7th of Novermber at the Danmarks Tekniske Universitet - DTU

The main purpose of the Symposium is to create a place where recent research results can be shared among Danish researchers, managers, students or other people interested in the subject.
The Symposium is organized by the [Danish Marine Mammal Society](https://dkmarinemammalsociety.wordpress.com/).

I am happy to be accepted for a full talk presentation at this yearâ€™s symposium. 
I will be giving the presentation titled: "Demographic history and phylogeography of bowhead whales (*Balaena mysticetus*) reflects past climate changes across the Arctic"

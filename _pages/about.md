I am an evolutionary biologist with a broad interest in ecology, evolution and adaptation of species, particularly large mammals. I am originally from Guatemala where I obtained a Licenciatura degree in Biology. I obtained my PhD at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands where I studied the evolutionary ecology of marine mammals employing simulated genetic data as well as genetic data collected from contemporary marine species.
I am currently a Postdoc at [Lorenzen's Group](https://globe.ku.dk/research/evogenomics/lorenzen-group/) at the University of Copenhagen where I am generating and analyzing contemporary and ancient genomic data of marine mammals, particularly polar bears.
The focus of my main research project is to understand how polar bear populations have changed over time and how climate fluctuations have influenced their demographic history.

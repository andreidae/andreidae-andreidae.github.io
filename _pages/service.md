I believe that been a scientist is not just about doing your own research but also about contributing to society in and outside academia.

I try to contribute to the academic community in different ways. I have volunteered for fieldwork, at the museum collections, as instructor, as journal reviewer, as editor or by organizing events.

# Journal reviews

Peer review process is important to keep science advancing and to promote high quality research. Therefore, I take review assignments seriously and usually spend a considerable effort if I agree to review a manuscript.

I have reviewed manuscripts for *Conservation Genetics*, *PeerJ*, *Molecular Ecology*, *Molecular Ecology Reports*, *Revista de Biología Marina y Oceanografía*, *Scientific Reports* and *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution*.

I use [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1518390/andrea-a-cabrera/peer-review/) to keep a record of my reviewer assignments. Have a look!

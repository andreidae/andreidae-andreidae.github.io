# Service
I believe that been a scientist is not just about doing your own research but also about contributing to society in and outside academia.

I try to contribute to the academic community in different ways. I have volunteered for fieldwork, at the museum collections, as instructor, as journal reviewer, as editor or by organizing events. 


Journal reviews

I have reviewed manuscripts for *Conservation Genetics*, *PeerJ*, *Molecular Ecology*, *Molecular Ecology Reports*, *Revista de Biología Marina y Oceanografía*, *Scientific Reports* and *Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution*.

I use [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/1518390/andrea-a-cabrera/peer-review/) to keep a record of my reviewer assignments. Have a look!

I believe that the peer review process is at the core of keeping science sane and pushing for higher quality. Review assignments are therefore something that I take seriously, and I usually spend a considerable effort if I agree to write a review.
